    // I chose Objective-C as the main project language file for this project (WhPhoneOS Calculator) as I intend to write this software piece in Objective-C to match the subsystem that is based on the system that this is based on. Swift wasn't an option, as it wasn't introduced into the base environment until later on. Objective-C is getting its own project language file, starting here.
